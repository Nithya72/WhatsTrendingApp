(not knowing anything about them all being insane I named him Taz after Tazmanian Devil cartoons i watched as a child) I was freaked out  by how it behaved. Just like a monkey with it's climbing, running and jumping all over my tiny apartment...
I asked some friends and they just replied, catnip. I Figured it was simply a food additive so I added about 1/4 of it to his can of food, he cleaned his plate. He definitely calmed down, for a couple days. I learned that love is not enough so i researched EVERY pet before I accepted the responsibility. Thus I have rescued and forever homed many pets... Cats, dogs, rats, gerbils, hamsters, snakes, iguanas, birds and even a had a pet porcupine aptly named ""QUILLFORD"". He was smart as a whip, loveable and would climb me like a tree, sit on my shoulder and nibble on my ear lobes. He was my favorite of all time.

There are people who stop their cars or step out of their houses to ask if I need help with my dog(a ride to the vet),and I have to repeat the same story:no,thank you,everything all right,she's only relaxing.Man,this is so embarassing!Cause she's doing it also in crowded areas.🙈
Really the most stubborn dogs in the world!But you can't educate them.They are like cats.Take it or leave it.I guess,I'm just the same,cause she's my 4th Chow.Someday,I will be lying at her side in the middle of the street!😀",-0.9105,0

"This honestly looks a lot like what it’s like for me trying to fight off sleep paralysis—small attempts to move, to keep the eyes open, but mostly stillness. Not to mention, if this were the case here then it would be especially hard to get out of the paralysis while laying on the back. If this cat was actually experiencing sleep paralysis, then the best thing would have been for the human to continue to move the cat’s position until he/she could snap out of it. I’ll never know for sure if this cat was experiencing sleep paralysis or just being lazy/comfortable, but I experience sleep paralysis on a regular basis, usually/especially without my medication and this looks very similar.",0.7199,1

So, a comfortable cat such peace may portend no significant earthquake threat in the very near future.",0.9642,0

Now, God commands ALL men and women to REPENT (turn away from their sinful way of life) and put their faith in His Son Jesus for the forgiveness of sins. DO NOT die in your sins, Jesus came to SAVE, not to condemn. Today is the day of salvation. Turn from your sins and put your faith in the Lord Jesus for the salvation of your souls. There is a day of judgment coming, and the Lord Jesus will judge the world righteously, and only those in Christ shall be able to stand on that great day.",0.8107,6
